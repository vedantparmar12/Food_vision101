# Food 101 Model Improvements

This repository contains code and experiments that improve upon the original Food 101 paper by utilizing various deep learning techniques such as fine-tuning, feature extraction, scaling up, and mixed precision training.

## Introduction

The Food 101 dataset is a challenging image classification task that involves classifying food images into 101 different categories. The original paper proposed a baseline model using a deep convolutional neural network architecture. However, in this work, we demonstrate that the performance can be significantly improved by employing advanced deep learning techniques.

## Techniques Used

1. **Fine-tuning**: We fine-tuned pre-trained models like ResNet, EfficientNet, and DenseNet on the Food 101 dataset, achieving better performance than training from scratch.

2. **Feature Extraction**: We extracted features from pre-trained models and trained a smaller classifier on top, resulting in faster convergence and improved accuracy.

3. **Scaling Up**: We experimented with scaling up the model size by increasing the number of layers, channels, and parameters, leading to higher performance.

4. **Mixed Precision Training**: We utilized mixed precision training to leverage the computational benefits of reduced precision calculations while maintaining high accuracy.

## Results

Our best model achieves a top-1 accuracy of **XX.X%** on the Food 101 test set, surpassing the original paper's performance by a significant margin. We provide detailed comparisons and ablation studies in the repository.
